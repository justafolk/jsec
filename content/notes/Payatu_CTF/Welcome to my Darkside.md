## Challenge:

## Description
```
     Interesting, you have noob skills, but the pros have gone dark. You found the
	 previous flag, but a researcher does more than just this, see the big 
	 picture, everything is a learning source to a researcher. Identify patterns.
	 Password leads to the network where you go DARK, but you need to prepare 
	 yourself. You got everything you need, learn and decode new skills.
```

- As this Challenge explicitly says that it's a continuation of last challenges, there's no searching required at first. In the description, the only word "DARK" is capitalized. I took that in consideration for later.

- Now, I got back to Warren Hasting's Github Account to scatter for any info. There was only one repository which seemed relevant i.e "DarkWeb".

- There were two files:
	1. PRO.html : Which had one pastebin link and nothing more relevant.

		```
		https://pastebin.com/BaZ5F02e
		```
	
	2. REAME.md : Containing a paragraph on Dark Web and suspiciously had **TOR** in bold.

- I opened the pastebin link only to find that it's locked.

- After some random tries like "Warren", "East of India", "The Battle of Plassey"; I remembered that **TOR** wouldn't just be an formatting error. So I tried "TOR" as the password and Voila it worked.
- After unlocking the bin, I got an Google Sheets link.

- Opening that link gave bunch of onion links further justifying the main theme of the challenge.

- I opened first 2 links and stopped by the trauma of dark web ads :( Suddenly had a look on the title of the spreadsheet, "no1337". Though at first I thought google docs had a limit of 1k cells, just for fun I went CTRL+G RETURN 1337.  and yeah, there was one link buried deep down there at cell A1337.

- Opened the link on Tor Browser to find this:
	![[Pasted image 20221016223333.png]]

- The message was:
	```
		BFVAG{QNEXJRONYYGURJNL}
		found passwords are reversible NeeTrihTThirTeeN.
	```

- After some tries with vignere cipher and beaufort cipher, It clicked me that the last word "NeeTrihTThirTeeN" clued "13" a.k.a "ROT13". After decrypting it with ROT13 cipher, I got the message:
	```
		OSINT{DARKWEBALLTHEWAY}
	```
- Which gave the final flag as:
	```
		PayatuCTF{DARKWEBALLTHEWAY}
	```
