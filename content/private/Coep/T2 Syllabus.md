DSA T2 syllabus
1. Sorting:
	- [x] Insertion Sort 
	- [x] Selection Sort
	- [x] bubble sort for coding.
	- [ ] Merge sort, 
	- [ ] quick sort for theory.
- [x] Pointers:
		Draw diagram for given code

- [x] Linked list:
- [x] Singly LL

coding questions may come for singly LL and pointer
In linked list there wil be also doubly and circular list ( theoretical only)
