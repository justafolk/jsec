### Functional Description
- One memory plane organized in several pages of the same size.
- Buffers
	- 2x   128bit buffers for code read optimization 
	- 1x    128bit buffer for data read optimization.
	- 1x     Write Buffer 
		- Manages page programming.
		- Equal size as page size  == 512 bytes
		- write only 
		- accesible along 1 Mbyte address space 
### Read Operations 
- Flash memory accesible through 8, 16, 32 bit reads.

### Code Read Optrimization
- Code read optimization is enabled if the bit EEFC_FMR.SCOD is cleared.

### Write commands 
- DMA write accesses must be 32 bit aligned. 
- if single byte is to be written in a 32 bit word, the rest of the bits should be 1s
- Only 0 values can be programmed using Flash technology;
- To program words in a page, first the page must be erased.
- 1 is the erased value
- 

partial page programming
- Data to be programmed must be contained in integer multiples of 128-bit address-aligned words. ÔÅ¨ 128-bit words can be programmed only if all the corresponding bits in the Flash array are erased (at logical value 1)

- there are sectors of 128 kbytes each
- 1 page == 512 bytes pages == 256 pages == 1 sectors 

- the first sectore is divided into 3 parts
  - 8kb
  - 8kb
  - 112kb
- there are 4 pages of data 
- 1 word = 2 bytes 
- 1 pages = 256 words = 2 * 128 words
- Flash write can only convert 1 to 0
- Flash erase sets all bits to 0

- internal rom : 0x00800000
- flash : 0x400000

- lock and unlock flash addresses to protect data from write and erase.

- When security is enabled, any access to the Flash,
SRAM, core registers and internal peripherals, either through the SW-DP, the ETM interface or the Fast Flash
Programming Interface, is blocked.
