The description bolds \"techie\" which suggests two things: \n\t1. It just indicates to search a tech associated website like github / gitlab. \n\t2. It clues us to find a user with an username \"techie\".\n- I spent better half of my time searching for a user \"techie\" on websites like github, dev.to, gitlab. \n- Plus, the end part of the description had to no relation to the actual OSINT whatsoever. It just downright distracted me to search on websites like code chef, leetcode, etc.\n- After spending unhealthy amount of time on tech websites searching for \"techie\", it clicked me!! what if this challenge is a continuation to the challenge before? As the description didn't explicitly mention to have last challenge in consideration, I was a bit skeptical to move forward.\n\n\t![[Pasted image 20221016213025.png]]\n- Just for the sake of it, I searched for the username in the last OSINT challenge \"Warren Hastings\" on Github. I just found one user named Warren Hasting on Github and immediately knew it I'm on right path.\n![[Pasted image 20221016213247.png]]\n\n- Before moving forward, there was one clue in the tweet replies of the first challenge.\n![[Pasted image 20221016213500.png]]\n- The above suggested that there's a repository containing the GovGenList on \"Warren Hasting's\" Github.\n- There were 6 repos on his github:\n![[Pasted image 20221016213654.png]]\n- And YEAH! GovGenList was one of em'. \n![[Pasted image 20221016213904.png]]\n- GovGenList repo had just one file _Readme.md_ with the Following text:\n\t```\n\t# Governor Generals of British India before 1857\n\tThis repository contains list of eminent Governor Generals of India before 1857\n\t\n\tWarren Hastings- 1773-1785\n\tEarl Cornwallis- 1786-1793\n\tMarquess Wellesley- 1798-1805\n\tGeorge Barlow- 1805-1807\n\tLord Minto- 1807-1813\n\tWilliam Bentinck- 1828-1835\n\tCharles MetCalfe - 1835-1836\n\tEarl of Dalhousie - 1848-1856\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tThe Key lies where it all started, when East India Company fought and set rule **in Bengal.**\n\t```\n- After reading the last line, I googled the part \"when East India Company fought and set rule **in Bengal.**\"\n![[Pasted image 20221016214418.png]]\n- And the answer was \"The Battle of Plassey _*1757*_\". Warren's account had a repository titled the same, so I scattered through that repository's text and found a base64 encoded message at the very end.\n\t![[Pasted image 20221016214705.png]]\n\n\t```\n\tT1NJTlR7R0lUSFVCX0xFQUtTfQ==\n\t```\n\n- After decoding this base64 message, we get:\n\t```\n\tOSINT{GITHUB_LEAKS}\n\t```\n- Giving us the Final Flag:\n\n\t```\n\tPayatuCTF{GITHUB_LEAKS}\n\t```\n\n### Next Challenges:\n2. 📁  [An Innocent Mistake](An%20Innocent%20Mistake.md)\n3. 📁  [Welcome to my Darkside](Welcome%20to%20my%20Darkside.md)\n\n📁  [Payatu CTF 2022](notes/Payatu_CTF/Payatu_ctf.md)","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T14:58:38.169245418Z","tags":["osint","ctf","payatuctf","2022"]},"/notes/Payatu_CTF/Catch-Me-If-You-Can":{"title":"Catch Me If You Can","content":"\r\n## Challenge :\r\n\u003ccenter\u003e \u003cimg src=\"../Pasted image 20221016200904.png\" /\u003e\u003c/center\u003e\r\n\r\n## Description:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUse your OSINT skills to identify various places where data can be collected from, on the Internet.\r\nImage is posted with tag #Goa2022, find the image with correct description that will give you the \r\naddress to the flag.

After a thorough search through all posts tagged #GOA2022 which were posted within a justifiable timeline, I couldn't really find any distinctive posts. Time to move on.\r\n- Second Place to search was twitter. Within a few seconds of scrolling through twitter's latest tab with the #GOA2022 tag, I came across the following post.\r\n\r\n\u003ccenter\u003e \u003cimg src=\"../Pasted image 20221016201758.png\" /\u003e \u003c/center\u003e\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- As this was quite a suggestive post, I was pretty sure this is the right path to follow.\r\n- Now following the description _\"the image with correct description that will give you the \r\naddress to the flag.\"_, I saw there was a alternative string attached to the post. \r\n\u003ccenter\u003e \u003cimg src=\"../Pasted image 20221016202114.png\" /\u003e \r\n\r\n \r\n```\r\nAlternative String: 15.4470235,73.8533068\r\n```\r\n\u003c/center\u003e\r\n\r\n- At this point, the whole challenge was just super obvious.

You got everything you need, learn and decode new skills.\r\n```\r\n\r\n- As this Challenge explicitly says that it's a continuation of last challenges, there's no searching required at first. In the description, the only word \"DARK\" is capitalized. I took that in consideration for later.\r\n\t![[Pasted image 20221016221435.png]]\r\n- Now, I got back to Warren Hasting's Github Account to scatter for any info. There was only one repository which seemed relevant i.e \"DarkWeb\".\r\n![[Pasted image 20221016221514.png]]\r\n- There were two files:\r\n\t1. PRO.html : Which had one pastebin link and nothing more relevant.\r\n\t\t![[Pasted image 20221016221810.png]]\r\n\t\t```\r\n\t\thttps://pastebin.com/BaZ5F02e\r\n\t\t```\r\n\t\r\n\t2. REAME.md : Containing a paragraph on Dark Web and suspiciously had **TOR** in bold. \r\n\t\t![[Pasted image 20221016222035.png]]\r\n\r\n- I opened the pastebin link only to find that it's locked.\r\n\t![[Pasted image 20221016222125.png]]\r\n- After some random tries like \"Warren\", \"East of India\", \"The Battle of Plassey\"; I remembered that **TOR** wouldn't just be an formatting error. So I tried \"TOR\" as the password and Voila it worked.\r\n- After unlocking the bin, I got an Google Sheets link.\r\n![[Pasted image 20221016222439.png]]\r\n\r\n- Opening that link gave bunch of onion links further justifying the main theme of the challenge.\r\n![[Pasted image 20221016222536.png]]\r\n- I opened first 2 links and stopped by the trauma of dark web ads :( Suddenly had a look on the title of the spreadsheet, \"no1337\". Though at first I thought google docs had a limit of 1k cells, just for fun I went CTRL+G RETURN 1337.  and yeah, there was one link buried deep down there at cell A1337.\r\n```\r\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xe6v6TpIXkr6mzoZmXeAlRj8YSN0gG3kt4WOiZTbLmY/edit#gid=0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\t![[Pasted image 20221016223134.png]]\r\n\r\n- Opened the link on Tor Browser to find this:\r\n\t![[Pasted image 20221016223333.png]]\r\n\r\n- The message was:\r\n\t```\r\n\t\tBFVAG{QNEXJRONYYGURJNL}\r\n\t\tfound passwords are reversible NeeTrihTThirTeeN.\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n- After some tries with vignere cipher and beaufort cipher, It clicked me that the last word \"NeeTrihTThirTeeN\" clued \"13\" a.k.a \"ROT13\". After decrypting it with ROT13 cipher, I got the message:\r\n\t```\r\n\t\tOSINT{DARKWEBALLTHEWAY}\r\n\t```\r\n- Which gave the final flag as:\r\n\t```\r\n\t\tPayatuCTF{DARKWEBALLTHEWAY}\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n### Other Challenges\r\n1. 📁  [Catch Me If You Can](Catch%20Me%20If%20You%20Can.md)\r\n2. 📁  [An Innocent Mistake](An%20Innocent%20Mistake.md)\r\n\r\n📁  [Payatu CTF 2022](notes/Payatu_CTF/Payatu_ctf.md)","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T14:58:38.177245422Z","tags":["osint","ctf","payatuctf","2022"]},"/notes/callouts":{"title":"Callouts","content":"\n## Callout support\n\nQuartz supports the same Admonition-callout syntax as Obsidian.\n\nThis includes\n- 12 Distinct callout types (each with several aliases)\n- Collapsable callouts\n\nSee [documentation on supported types and syntax here](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts).\n\n## Showcase\n\n\u003e [!EXAMPLE] Examples\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: example\n\n\u003e [!note] Notes\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: note\n\n\u003e [!abstract] Summaries \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: abstract, summary, tldr\n\n\u003e [!info] Info \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: info, todo\n\n\u003e [!tip] Hint \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: tip, hint, important\n\n\u003e [!success] Success \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: success, check, done\n\n\u003e [!question] Question \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: question, help, faq\n\n\u003e [!warning] Warning \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: warning, caution, attention\n\n\u003e [!failure] Failure \n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: failure, fail, missing\n\n\u003e [!danger] Error\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: danger, error\n\n\u003e [!bug] Bug\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: bug\n\n\u003e [!quote] Quote\n\u003e\n\u003e Aliases: quote, cite\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T14:58:38.189245429Z","tags":[]},"/notes/config":{"title":"Configuration","content":"\n## Configuration\nQuartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems?

You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik).

If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! Follow the steps below.\n\n### Enable GitHub Actions Permissions\nBy default, GitHub disables workflows from modifying your files (for good reason!). However, Quartz needs this to write the actual site files back to GitHub.\n\nHead to `Settings \u003e Action \u003e General \u003e Workflow Permissions` and choose `Read and Write Permissions`\n\n![[notes/images/github-actions.png]]\n*Enable GitHub Actions*\n\n### Enable GitHub Pages\n\nHead to the 'Settings' tab of your forked repository and go to the 'Pages' tab.\n\n1.

Set a custom domain here if you have one!\n\n![Enable GitHub Pages](/notes/images/github-pages.png)*Enable GitHub Pages*\n\n### Pushing Changes\nTo see your changes on the internet, we need to push it them to GitHub. Quartz is a `git` repository so updating it is the same workflow as you would follow as if it were just a regular software project.\n\n```shell\n# Navigate to Quartz folder\ncd \u003cpath-to-quartz\u003e\n\n# Commit all changes\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message describing changes\"\n\n# Push to GitHub to update site\ngit push origin hugo\n```\n\nNote: we specifically push to the `hugo` branch here. Our GitHub action automatically runs everytime a push to is detected to that branch and then updates the `master` branch for redeployment.\n\n### Setting up the Site\nNow let's get this site up and running. Never hosted a site before? No problem. Have a fancy custom domain you already own or want to subdomain your Quartz? That's easy too.\n\nHere, we take advantage of GitHub's free page hosting to deploy our site. Change `baseURL` in `/config.toml`. \n\nMake sure that your `baseURL` has a trailing `/`!\n\n[Reference `config.toml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/config.toml)\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e/\"\n```\n\nIf you are using this under a subdomain (e.g. `\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz`), include the trailing `/`. **You need to do this especially if you are using GitHub!**\n\n```toml\nbaseURL = \"https://\u003cYOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME\u003e.github.io/quartz/\"\n```\n\nChange `cname` in `/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`. Again, if you don't have a custom domain to use, you can use `\u003cYOUR-USERNAME\u003e.github.io`.\n\nPlease note that the `cname` field should *not* have any path `e.g. end with /quartz` or have a trailing `/`.\n\n[Reference `deploy.yaml` here](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/blob/hugo/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)\n\n```yaml {title=\".github/workflows/deploy.yaml\"}\n- name: Deploy  \n  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3  \n  with:  \n\tgithub_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # this can stay as is, GitHub fills this in for us!\n\tpublish_dir: ./public  \n\tpublish_branch: master\n\tcname: \u003cYOUR-DOMAIN\u003e\n```\n\nHave a custom domain?

You can turn this off in your Quartz by running this command.\n\n```shell\n# in the root of your Quartz (same folder as config.toml)\ngit config core.ignorecase true\n\n# or globally (not recommended)\ngit config --global core.ignorecase true\n```\n\n### Can I publish only a subset of my pages?\nYes! Quartz makes selective publishing really easy. Heres a guide on [excluding pages from being published](notes/ignore%20notes.md).\n\n### Can I host this myself and not on GitHub Pages?\nYes! All built files can be found under `/public` in the `master` branch. More details under [hosting](notes/hosting.md).\n\n### `command not found: hugo-obsidian`\nMake sure you set your `GOPATH` correctly! This will allow your terminal to correctly recognize `hugo-obsidian` as an executable.\n\n```shell\n# Add the following 2 lines to your ~/.bash_profile (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\nexport GOPATH=/Users/$USER/go\nexport PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH\n\n# In your current terminal, to reload the session\nsource ~/.bash_profile # again, (~/.zshrc if you are on Mac)\n```\n\n### How come my notes aren't being rendered?\nYou probably forgot to include front matter in your Markdown files. You can either setup [Obsidian](notes/obsidian.md) to do this for you or you need to manually define it. More details in [the 'how to edit' guide](notes/editing.md).\n\n### My custom domain isn't working!\nWalk through the steps in [the hosting guide](notes/hosting.md) again. Make sure you wait 30 min to 1 hour for changes to take effect.\n\n### How do I setup analytics?\nQuartz by default uses [Plausible](https://plausible.io/) for analytics. \n\nIf you would prefer to use Google Analytics, you can follow this [guide in the Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/templates/internal/#google-analytics). \n\nAlternatively, you can also import your Google Analytics data into Plausible by [following this guide](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).\n\n\n### How do I change the content on the home page?\nTo edit the main home page, open `/content/_index.md`.\n\n### How do I change the colours?\nYou can change the theme by editing `assets/custom.scss`. More details on customization and themeing can be found in the [customization guide](notes/config.md).\n\n### How do I add images?\nYou can put images anywhere in the `/content` folder.\n\n```markdown\nExample image (source is in content/notes/images/example.png)\n![Example Image](/content/notes/images/example.png)\n```\n\n### My Interactive Graph and Backlinks aren't up to date\nBy default, the `linkIndex.json` (which Quartz needs to generate the Interactive Graph and Backlinks) are not regenerated locally. To set that up, see the guide on [local editing](notes/editing.md)\n\n### Can I use React/Vue/some other framework?\nNot out of the box. You could probably make it work by editing `/layouts/_default/single.html` but that's not what Quartz is designed to work with. 99% of things you are trying to do with those frameworks you can accomplish perfectly fine using just vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.\n\n## Still Stuck?\nQuartz isn't perfect! If you're still having troubles, file an issue in the GitHub repo with as much information as you can reasonably provide. Alternatively, you can message me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_jzhao) and I'll try to get back to you as soon as I can.\n\n🐛 [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz/issues)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-08T14:58:38.193245431Z","tags":[]},"/notes/updating":{"title":"Updating","content":"\nHaven't updated Quartz in a while and want all the cool new optimizations?
